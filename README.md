# Windows Cleaner
A windows app ( written in c# ) that helps users to free more space by
deleting unnecessary files/folders like Temporary folders, log files, duplicate
files, 0 Byte files, RecycleBin in one-click. It provides a one-stop platform to
view and take actions to large files/folders/apps that take huge chunks of disk
space.

## Why did I made this?
I have a gaming laptop with 1 TB of Storage. 1 TB of storage seems quite a lot until I start installing games 
and building softwares and editing videos. So it is normal that software will generate chache files, log files 
that can be deleted later. There are ocasions when I copy same files instead of moving those files, that turn 
of having duplicate files.

## The Story
So I wanted a an application for windows that can help me keep my device clean. 
There a software for Android platform but I could not find for Windows So I took this as opportunity to develop an application.
To start some where I must know a programming language that will be easy to code for me. Somewhere in my mind had the idea of 
Visual Basic becasue I had learned somethings about it a decade ago, but that was not enough to build an application So I took 
the help of ChatGPT and within few weeks We made it (ChatGPT and Me :) ).
